Working with Classes in Grasshopper with the @hops.component decorator



I always wanted to get my head around the @hops.component decorator.

Turns out it has to do with classes in python.



Here is an app .py file that should explain it all in a few hundred lines of code.

I drew it out a bit and allowed github copilot to do all the teaching with a few prompts from my python textbook.



WORKING WITH CLASSES

CREATING CLASS INSTANCE

@CLASSMETHOD DECORATOR

CREATING INSTANCE METHOD

CREATING STATIC METHOD

@STATICMETHOD DECORATOR



TIP: comment our the script you do not need to run in VSC with single triple ''' '''

and RUN the

class SculptureFaculty();

that you want to view in the terminal



RUN the @hops.components to drop them into a hops node on the grasshopper canvas.



I have decided that I have no need for complete class function/methods in grasshopper,

rather, I have chosen to define simple function/methods instead with the @hops.component wrapper.



Enjoy,
